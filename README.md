# Simple crypto app made in SwiftUI
Created as a first step on my journey to learn Swift for a future project (*epic foreshadow!1!!*)

Thank you to [@SwiftfulThinking](https://github.com/swiftfulthinking) for the awesome free learning materials!

> This project is meant to serve as a Proof-of-Completion and Proof-of-Knowledge of Swift/SwiftUI concepts covered in [Swiftful Thinking's SwiftUI Crypto App (Intermediate Level) course on Youtube.](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwvDm4Vfkdphbc3bgy_LpLRQ9DDfFGcFu)
